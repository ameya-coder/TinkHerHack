Project Description
This project is a Leaflet-based Emergency Reporting System that allows users to mark emergency locations on an interactive map. The backend, built with Flask and SQLite, stores and retrieves emergency reports, enabling real-time updates and management of alerts.

The Problem statement
Emergencies require fast action, but authorities are often slow to respond due to delayed reports and lack of real-time data. Our project provides a quick and efficient way for people to mark emergencies on a shared, live map, ensuring faster awareness and response by the community and emergency services.

The Solution
Why wait for slow-moving authorities when emergencies demand instant action? Our platform puts emergency reporting in the hands of the people! With a simple tap, users can mark incidents on a live map, ensuring faster awareness and response from both the community and first responders. No more delaysâ€”just real-time alerts, instant visibility, and a safer world!
